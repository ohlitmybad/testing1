Indeed, players in teams that hold less possession have fewer opportunities to lose the ball (for example playing fewer passes on average) and more opportunities to win it back (since the opponent has the ball for longer). Instead, we use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjusted possessions won = Tackles won + defensive duels won + interceptions, adjusted for 100 ball possessions</li>\n<li>Adjusted possessions lost = Inaccurate passes + unsuccessful offensive duels, adjusted for 100 ball possessions</li>\n<li>Possession +/- = Adjusted possessions won - Adjusted possessions lost</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div><br/>\n<hr class=\"tool-divider\"/>\n<div id=\"teammetrics\">\n<h3>Team Metrics</h3>\n<h4>Team Plots</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goals per 90</strong><br/>Goals scored per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Goals conceded per 90</strong><br/>Goals conceded per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>xG per 90</strong><br/>Expected goals per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Shots on target per 90</strong><br/>Shots on target per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Shots on target %</strong><br/>Percentage of shots on target.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>SoT against per 90</strong><br/>Shots on target against per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Touches in box per 90</strong><br/>Number of touches in the opponent's box per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Defensive duels per 90</strong><br/>Amount of defensive (ground) duels contested per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Defensive duels won %</strong><br/>Percentage of defensive (ground) duels won.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Aerial duels per 90</strong><br/>Amount of aerial duels contested per 90 minutes</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Aerial duels won %</strong><br/>Percentage of aerial duels won.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Passes completed per 90</strong><br/>Amount of passes completed per 90 minutes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Pass accuracy %</strong><br/>Percentage of completed passes out of total passes.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Possession %</strong><br/>Average possession across all games.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Passes per possession</strong><br/>Amount of passes attempted for every possession.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Counter attacks</strong><br/>Open play possession ending with a successful final third action where the team is quickly transitioning from defense to attack after the opponent lost possession.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>Positional attacks</strong><br/>Open play possession ending with a successful final third action, that is not a counter attack.</li>\n<br/><li><strong>PPDA</strong><br/>Passes allowed per defensive action.
